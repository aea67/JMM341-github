# READ ME

## Best Practices

The objective of this task is to apply best practices to your knowledge of HTML and building web pages.

You are not expected to complete this in one session. What you do not finish in class, spend time practicing at home. Always start from the beginning. **Do not copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**

## Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking the "Clone or Download" button, then select "Download ZIP".

Included in the directory on your computer are the following files:


- fix-me.html
- flynn.jpg
- quorra.jpg
- README.md (this file)

### Here is what you need to do

**All work needs to be done in the `exercise-04` folder.** (It may be named `exercise-04-master`.)

You need to complete the reading for Week 5 before attempting this assignment.

The file `fix-me.html` is incorrect and broken. Your task is to fix it.

1. Change the name of the file to `index.html`.

2. Following what you have learned in the "HTML Best Practices" article, fix all the errors in the document.

3. At the end of the exercise, [validate your code](https://validator.w3.org/). Make sure there are no errors, either in existence from the beginning, or introduced as you fixed the file.

### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class.  If you finish, have your professor give it a look.  If you *are* finished, re-download the repository files and go through the fixes again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
